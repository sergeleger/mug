* So... what are containers?

: Jails
: Namespaces
: Cgroups
: Light-weight virtualization
: Process isolation
: Docker

* Definitions

- "... operating system feature(s) in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances."

- "A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings."

- "LinuX Containers (LXC) combines the kernel's *cgroups* and support for isolated *namespaces* to provide an isolated environment for applications."

: Mostly concentrating on LXC
: I'm not a big Docker user.
: Mostly, because I didn't know the trade-offs.
: Until...

* Let's build a container

* Namespaces

Control what a process can see.

- PID (process table)
- UTS (unix timeshare)
- Mount
- Network
- IPC (inter-process communication)
- User (Linux users and groups)
- Cgroup (control groups)

* Cgroups

Control what a process can use.

- Memory
- CPU
- CPU Accounting
- CPU Sets
- PIDs
- Blkio
- Devices
- Net_prio
- Freezer

: these are controllers
: blkio -> block IO controller
: cpuacct -> cpu accounting
: net_prio -> network priority
